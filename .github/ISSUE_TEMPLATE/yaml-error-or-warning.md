about: VS Code complains over your YAML 
labels: 'yaml'

<!-- 

- Is it an YAML parsing error?
  This extension relies on https://github.com/eemeli/yaml to parse and validate
  the raw YAML. To test this, update the language of the file to YAML 
  using âŒ˜K M or Ctrl+K M. If the error is still there, please report to that repo
  and then report back when it gets fixed there

- Is a HA scheme error?
   Feel free to fix this yourself, it's quite easy, HowTo here:

Please include the related YAML code

```YAML
your:
   - yaml
```

or point to a repository containing your Home Assistant Configuration
