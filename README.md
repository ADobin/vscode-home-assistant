# Home Assistant for VS Code

This is a preview / work in progress of the Home Assistant Extension for VS Code. By being connected to Home Assistant it provides auto completion for your entity_id's.

Then when you type ```entity_id:``` the autocomplete list should be populated with your entities

## Configuration

You need to set your **Home Assistant Root URL** and a **Long Lived Access Token**. After installing, when you first try to set an entity_id the extension will ask you to set them. It's also possible to set them using the defaul settings page, go to 'Preferences: Open Settings (UI)', then go to 'Extensions' and 'Home Assistant'.
